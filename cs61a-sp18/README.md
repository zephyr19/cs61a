# [CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/)

Spring 2018

Instructor: John DeNero

One day I woke up, finding the website contents were all removed!!! It's turn out that the new semester was coming, the website clear all the contents in fa19 for the sp20. So, I have to find the latest available website, which is sp18, and continue to learn.

Some remained part II contents: Lab08 and HW05 in fa19 will be replaced by Lab08, HW06 and HW07 in sp18.

Start Part III with sp18: **Scheme**
